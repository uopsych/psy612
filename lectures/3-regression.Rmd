## Regression

Regression is a general data analytic system, meaning lots of things fall under the umbrella of regression. This system can handle a variety of forms of relations, although all forms have to be specified in a linear way. Usefully, we can incorporate IVs of all nature -- continuous, categorical, nominal, ordinal....

The output of regression includes both effect sizes and, if using frequentist or Bayesian software, statistical significance. We can also incorporate multiple influences (IVs) and account for their intercorrelations.

### Regression

- **Adjustment**: Statistically control for known effects

  + If everyone had the same level of SES, would education still predict wealth?

- **Prediction**: We can develop models based on what's happened in the past to predict what will happen in the future.

  + Insurance premiums
  + Graduate school... success?
  
- **Explanation**: explaining the influence of one or more variables on some outcome. 

  + Does this intervention affect reaction time?
  + Does self-esteem predict relationship quality?

## Regression equation

What is a regression equation?

- Functional relationship

  - Ideally like a physical law $(E = MC^2)$
  - In practice, it's never as robust as that. 
  - Note: this equation may not represent the true causal process!

How do we uncover the relationship?

---

### How does Y vary with X?

- The regression of Y (DV) on X (IV) corresponds to the line that gives the mean value of Y corresponding to each possible value of X

- $\large E(Y|X)$

- "Our best guess" regardless of whether our model includes categories or continuous predictor variables

## Regression Equation

There are two ways to think about our regression equation. They're similar to each other, but they produce different outputs.

$$\Large Y_i = b_{0} + b_{1}X_i +e_i$$

$$\Large \hat{Y_i} = b_{0} + b_{1}X_i$$


The first is the equation that represents how each **observed outcome** $(Y_i)$ is calculated. This observed value is the sum of some constant $(b_0)$, the weighted $(b_1)$ observed values of the predictors $(X_i)$ and error $(e_i)$ that cannot be covered by the observed data.

???

$\hat{Y}$ signifies the fitted score -- no error

The difference between the fitted and observed score is the residual ($e_i$)

There is a different e value for each observation in the dataset

$$\Large \hat{Y_i} = b_{0} + b_{1}X_i$$


The second is the equation that represents our expected or **fitted value** of the outcome $(\hat{Y_i})$, sometimes referred to as the "predicted value." This expected value is the sum of some constant $(b_0)$, the weighted $(b_1)$ observed values of the predictors $(X_i)$.

Note that $Y_i - \hat{Y_i} = e_i$.

## OLS
- How do we find the regression estimates? 
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation
- Minimizes deviations 

$$ min\sum(Y_{i}-\hat{Y})^{2} $$ 

- Other estimation procedures possible (and necessary in some cases)

$$\Large Y_i = b_{0} + b_{1}X_i +e_i$$

$$\Large \hat{Y_i} = b_{0} + b_{1}X_i$$

## OLS

The line that yields the smallest sum of squared deviations

$$\Large \Sigma(Y_i - \hat{Y_i})^2$$
$$\Large = \Sigma(Y_i - (b_0+b_{1}X_i))^2$$
$$\Large = \Sigma(e_i)^2$$

--

In order to find the OLS solution, you could try many different coefficients $(b_0 \text{ and } b_{1})$ until you find the one with the smallest sum squared deviation. Luckily, there are simple calculations that will yield the OLS solution every time.

---
## Regression coefficient, $b_{1}$

$$\large b_{1} = \frac{cov_{XY}}{s_{x}^{2}} = r_{xy} \frac{s_{y}}{s_{x}}$$

<!-- $$\large r_{xy} = \frac{s_{xy}}{s_xs_y}$$ -->


What units is the regression coefficient in?

--

The regression coefficient (slope) equals the estimated change in Y for a 1-unit change in X  

---

$$\large b_{1} = r_{xy} \frac{s_{y}}{s_{x}}$$


If the standard deviation of both X and Y is equal to 1: 

$$\large b_1 = r_{xy} \frac{s_{y}}{s_{x}} = r_{xy} \frac{1}{1} = r_{xy} = \beta_{yx} = b_{yx}^*$$

---

## Standardized regression equation

$$\large Z_{y_i} = b_{yx}^*Z_{x_i}+e_i$$

$$\large b_{yx}^* = b_{yx}\frac{s_x}{s_y} = r_{xy}$$
--

According to this regression equation, when $X = 0, Y = 0$. Our interpretation of the coefficient is that a one-standard deviation increase in X is associated with a $b_{yx}^*$ standard deviation increase in Y. Our regression coefficient is equivalent to the correlation coefficient *when we have only one predictor in our model.*

---

## Estimating the intercept, $b_0$

- intercept serves to adjust for differences in means between X and Y

$$\Large \hat{Y_i} = \bar{Y} + r_{xy} \frac{s_{y}}{s_{x}}(X_i-\bar{X})$$
- if standardized, intercept drops out  

- otherwise, intercept is where regression line crosses the y-axis at X = 0  

???
##Make this point
- Also, notice that when $X = \bar{X}$ the regression line goes through  $\bar{Y}$

???
$$\Large b_0 = \bar{Y} - b_1\bar{X}$$
---

The intercept adjusts the location of the regression line to ensure that it runs through the point $(\bar{X}, \bar{Y}).$  We can calculate this value using the equation:

$$\Large b_0 = \bar{Y} - b_1\bar{X}$$

---

## Example

[Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/poll/350486/record-high-support-same-sex-marriage.aspx) has been tracking support for same-sex marriage since 1996. They provide data for the `percent` of respondents who agree with the statement, "Do you think marriages between same-sex couples should or should not be recognized by the law as valid, with the same rights as traditional marriages?"

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
gallup = read_csv(here("data/gallup_marriage.csv"))
describe(gallup[,c("year", "percent")], fast = T)
cor(gallup$year, gallup$percent)
```

---

If we regress percent onto year:

```{r, echo = c(1:7, 9)}
r = cor(gallup$year, gallup$percent)
m_year = mean(gallup$year)
m_percent = mean(gallup$percent)
s_year = sd(gallup$year)
s_percent = sd(gallup$percent)

b1 = r*(s_percent/s_year)
b1
b0 = m_percent - b1*m_year
b0
```


How will this change if we regress year onto percent?

---

```{r}
(b1 = r*(s_percent/s_year))
(b0 = m_percent - b1*m_year)
```


```{r}
(b1 = r*(s_year/s_percent))
(b0 = m_year - b1*m_percent)
```

---
## In `R`

```{r}
fit.1 <- lm(percent ~ year, data = gallup)
summary(fit.1)
```

???

**Things to discuss**

- Coefficient estimates
- Statistical tests (covered in more detail soon)

---


```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, message = F}
ggplot(gallup, aes(x=year, y=percent)) +
    geom_point() +    
    geom_smooth(method=lm,   # Add linear regression line
                se=FALSE) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 20)
```

### Data, fitted, and residuals

```{r}
library(broom)
model_info = augment(fit.1)
head(model_info)
```

```{r}
describe(model_info, fast = T)
```

???

Point out the average of the residuals is 0, just like average deviation from the mean is 0.

## Regression to the mean

An observation about heights was part of the motivation to develop the regression equation: If you selected a parent who was exceptionally tall (or short), their child was almost always not as tall (or as short).

```{r, echo = F, warning = F, message = F, fig.height = 4}
library(psychTools)
library(tidyverse)
heights = psychTools::galton
mod = lm(child~parent, data = heights)
point = 902
heights = broom::augment(mod)


heights %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = parent, y = child)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = .3) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 72), color = "red") +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 72), color = "red") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 20)
```

## Regression to the mean

This phenomenon is known as **regression to the mean.** This describes the phenomenon in which an random variable produces an extreme score on a first measurement, but a lower score on a second measurement. 

.pull-left[
We can see this in the standardized regression equation:

$$\hat{Y_i} = r_{xy}(X_i) + e_i$$
In that the slope coefficient can never be greater than 1.
