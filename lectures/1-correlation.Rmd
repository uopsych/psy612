## Relationships

- What is the relationship between IV and DV?

- Measuring relationships depend on type of measurement

- You have primarily been working wtih categorical IVs (*t*-test, chi-square)

---
## Scatter Plot with best fit line
```{r,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
library(psych)
library(psychTools)
library(tidyverse)
library(RColorBrewer)
galton.data <- galton
purples = brewer.pal(n = 3, name = "Purples")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
ggplot(galton.data, aes(x=parent, y=child)) +
    geom_jitter() +    
    geom_smooth(method=lm,   # Add linear regression line
                se=FALSE) +     # Don't add shaded confidence region
    labs(x = "parent height", y = "child height")

## Review of Dispersion

Variation (sum of squares)

$$SS = {\sum{(x-\bar{x})^2}}$$
$$SS = {\sum{(x-\mu)^2}}$$
---

## Review of Dispersion
Variance

$$\large s^{2} = {\frac{\sum{(x-\bar{x})^2}}{N-1}}$$

$$\large\sigma^{2} = {\frac{\sum{(x-\mu)^2}}{N}}$$

---

## Review of Dispersion

Standard Deviation

$$\large s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum{(x-\bar{x})^2}}{N-1}}$$

$$\large\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum{(x-\mu)^2}}{N}}$$

---

class: center

Formula for standard error of the mean?

--

$$\sigma_M = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}$$

$$\sigma_M = \frac{\hat{s}}{\sqrt{N}}$$

---
## Associations

- i.e., relationships
- to look at continuous variable associations we need to think in terms of how variables relate to one another

---
## Associations

Covariation (cross products)

**Sample:**

$$\large SS = {\sum{(x-\bar{x})(y-\bar{y})}}$$

**Population:**

$$SS = {\sum{{(x-\mu_{x}})(y-\mu_{y})}}$$

---
## Associations

Covariance

**Sample:**

$$\large cov_{xy}^{2} = {\frac{\sum{(x-\bar{x})(y-\bar{y})}}{N-1}}$$

**Population:**

$$\large \sigma_{xy}^{2} = {\frac{\sum{(x-\mu_{x})(y-\mu_{y})}}{N}}$$

--
>- Covariance matrix is basis for many analyses
>- What are some issues that may arise when comparing covariances?

---
## Associations
Correlations

**Sample:**

$$\large r_{xy} = {\frac{\sum({z_{x}z_{y})}}{N}}$$

**Population:**

$$\large \rho_{xy} = {\frac{cov(X,Y)}{\sigma_{x}\sigma_{y}}}$$


Many other formulas exist for specific types of data, these were more helpful when we computed everything by hand (more on this later).

---

## Correlations


- How much two variables are linearly related

- -1 to 1

- Invariant to changes in mean or scaling

- Most common (and basic) effect size measure

- Will use to build our regression model

---

## Correlations

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
ggplot(galton.data, aes(x=parent, y=child)) +
    geom_jitter(alpha = .4) +
    geom_smooth(method=lm,   # Add linear regression line
                se=FALSE) +     # Don't add shaded confidence region
    labs(x = "parent height", y = "child height") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 20)
```

---

## Conceptually 

Ways to think about a correlation:

* How two vectors of numbers co-relate

* Product of z-scores
  
  + Mathematically, it is
  
* The average squared distance between two vectors in the same space

* The cosine of the angle between Y and the projected Y from X $(\hat{Y})$.

## Statistical test

Hypothesis testing

$$\large H_{0}: \rho_{xy} = 0$$

$$\large H_{A}: \rho_{xy} \neq 0$$

Assumes:
- Observations are independent
- Symmetric bivariate distribution (joint probability distribution)

---

  theme_bw(base_size = 20)
```

---

### Sampling distribution?

--

The sampling distribution we use depends on our null hypothesis.

--

If our null hypothesis is the nil $(\rho = 0)$ , then we can use a ***t*-distribution** to estimate the statistical significance of a correlation.

## Statistical test


Test statistic

$$\large t = {\frac{r}{SE_{r}}}$$
--
.pull-left[
$$\large SE_r = \sqrt{\frac{1-r^2}{N-2}}$$

$$\large t = {\frac{r}{\sqrt{\frac{1-r^{2}}{N-2}}}}$$
]

.pull-right[
$$\large DF = N-2$$

## Power calculations
```{r}
library(pwr)
pwr.r.test(n = , r = .1, sig.level = .05 , power = .8)
pwr.r.test(n = , r = .3, sig.level = .05 , power = .8)
```

---
## Power calculations
- But what is your confidence?

- N = 84 gives you CI[.09, .48]

- Schönbrodt & Perugini (2013) suggest correlations 'stabilize' at 250+ regardless of effect size

- CI[.19, .39]

## Fisher's r to z' transformation

- Skewed sampling distribution will rear its head when:

    * $H_{0}: \rho \neq 0$

    * Calculating confidence intervals

    * Testing two correlations against one another

---

```{r, echo = F}
ggplot(data.frame(x = seq(-.99, .99)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = function(x) r_sampling(x, r = .75, 
                                             n = 30),
                geom = "area", fill = purples[3]) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-.99, .99)) +
  ggtitle("r = .75, n = 30") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 20)
```


---
## Fisher’s r to z’ transformation

- r to z':

$$\large z^{'} = {\frac{1}{2}}ln{\frac{1+r}{1-r}}$$

---
## Fisher’s r to z’ transformation

```{r, echo = F}
r = seq(-.99,.99,.01)
z = psych::fisherz(r)
data.frame(r,z) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = r, y = z)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous(expr(r))+
  scale_y_continuous(expr(z_r))+
  theme_bw(base_size = 20)
```


---
##  Steps for computing confidence interval

1. Transform r into z'
2. Compute CI as you normally would using z'
3. revert back to r

$$ SE_z = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N-3}}$$

$$\large r = {\frac{e^{2z'}-1}{e^{2z'}+1}}$$
---

### Example

In a sample of 42 students, you calculate a correlation of 0.44 between hours spent outside on Saturday and self-rated health. What is the precision of your estimate?

```{r, echo = F}
r = .44
N = 42
z = fisherz(r)
se = 1/(sqrt(N-3))
ct = qt(p = .975, df = N-2, lower.tail = T)
lbz = z-(se*ct)
ubz = z+(se*ct)
lb = fisherz2r(lbz)
ub = fisherz2r(ubz)
```


.pull-left[
$$z = {\frac{1}{2}}ln{\frac{1+.74}{1-.74}} = `r round(z,2)`$$
$$SE_z = \frac{1}{\sqrt{42-3}} = `r round(se,2)`$$

$$CI_{Z_{LB}} = `r round(z,2)`-(`r round(ct,3)`)`r round(se,2)` = `r round(lbz,2)`$$

$$CI_{Z_{UB}} = `r round(z,2)`+(`r round(ct,3)`)`r round(se,2)` = `r round(ubz,2)`$$
]

---


$$CI_{r_{LB}} = {\frac{e^{2(`r round(lbz,2)`)}-1}{e^{2(`r round(lbz,2)`)}+1}} = `r round(lb,2)`$$

$$CI_{r_{UB}} = = {\frac{e^{2(`r round(ubz,2)`)}-1}{e^{2(`r round(ubz,2)`)}+1}} = `r round(ub,2)`$$

---

## Comparing two correlations

Again, we use the Fisher’s r to z’ transformation. Here, we're transforming the correlations into z's, then using the difference between z's to calculate the test statistic. 

$$Z = \frac{z_1^{'}- z_2^{'}}{se_{z_1-z_2}}$$

$$se_{z_1-z_2} = \sqrt{se_{z_1}+se_{z_2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1-3}+\frac{1}{n_2-3}}$$
---

## Example

Replication of Hill et al. (2012) where they found that the correlation between narcissism and happiness was greater for young adults compared to older adults

.pull-left[
### Young adults
$$N = 327$$
$$r = .402$$
]

.pull-right[
### Older adults
$$N = 273$$
$$r = .283$$
]



$$H_0:\rho_1 = \rho_2$$
$$H_1:\rho_1 \neq \rho_2$$

---

```{r, echo = F}
z1 = fisherz(.402)
z2 = fisherz(.283)
n1 = 327
n2 = 273
se = sqrt(1/(n1-3) + 1/(n2-3))

zstat = (z1-z2)/se
```


$$z_1^{'} = {\frac{1}{2}}ln{\frac{1+.402}{1-.402}} = `r round(z1,3)`$$

$$z_2^{'} = {\frac{1}{2}}ln{\frac{1+.283}{1-.283}} = `r round(z2,3)`$$

$$se_{z_1-z_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{327-3}+\frac{1}{273-3}} = `r round(se,3)`$$

$$\text{Test statistic} = \frac{z_1^{'}-z_2^{'}}{se_{z_1-z_2}} = \frac{`r round(z1,3)`- `r round(z2,3)`}{`r round(se,3)`} = `r round(zstat,3)`$$

```{r}
pnorm(abs(zstat), lower.tail = F)*2
```

## Effect size

- The strength of relationship between two variables

- $\eta^2$, cohen’s d, cohen’s f, hedges g, $R^2$ , Risk-ratio, etc

- Significance is a function of effect size and sample size

- Statistical significance $\neq$ practical significance

---
## Effect size
How big is practical?

- Cohen (.1, .3., .5)
- Meyer & Hemphill .3 is average
- Rosenthaul:

Drug TX?  | Alive |  Dead
----------|-------|--------
Treatment |  65   |  35
No Tx     |  35   |  65


---
## What is the size of the correlation?
- Chemotherapy and breast cancer survival?
- Batting ability and hit success on a single at bat?
- Antihistamine use and reduced sneezing/runny nose?
- Combat exposure and PTSD?
- Ibuprofen on pain reduction?
- Gender and weight?
- Therapy and well being?
- Observer ratings of attractiveness?
- Gender and arm strength?
- Nearness to equator and daily temperature for U.S.?

## Questions to ask yourself:
- What is your N?
- What is the typical effect size in the field?
- Study design?
- What is your DV?
- Importance?
- Same method as IV (method variance)?

---

## Correlation matrices

Correlations are both a descriptive and an inferential statistic. As a descriptive statistic, they're useful for understanding what's going on in a larger dataset. 

Like we use the `summary()` or `describe()` (psych) functions to examine our dataset _before we run any infernetial tests_, we should also look at the correlation matrix. 

---

```{r}
library(psych)
data(bfi)
head(bfi)
```

---

```{r}
cor(bfi)
```

---

```{r}
round(cor(bfi, use = "pairwise"),2)
```

---

```{r}
round(cor(bfi, use = "complete"),2)
```

---

With **pairwise deletion**, different sets of cases contribute to different correlations.  That maximizes the sample sizes, but can lead to problems if the data are missing for some systematic reason.

**Listwise deletion** (often referred to in `R` as use complete cases) doesn't have the same issue of biasing correlations, but does result in smaller samples and potentially limited generalizability.

A good practice is comparing the different matrices; if the correlation values are very different, this suggests that the missingness that affects pairwise deletion is systematic.

---

```{r}
round(cor(bfi, use = "pairwise")- cor(bfi, use = "complete"),2)
```
---

## Visualizing correlation matrices

A single correlation can be informative; a correlation matrix is more than the sum of its parts. 

Correlation matrices can be used to infer larger patterns of relationships. You may be one of the gifted who can look at a matrix of numbers and see those patterns immediately. Or you can use **heat maps** to visualize correlation matrices. 

```{r, results = 'hide'}
library(corrplot)
```

---

```{r}
corrplot(cor(bfi, use = "pairwise"), method = "square")
```

---

---
## Other correlation tests:
1. Set of correlations
2. Dependent correlations (i.e., within same group)
  These are more easily tested via Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)
3. Intra Class Correlation (ICC)

- Again, best to do these tests in another framework (e.g., interaction, SEM, MLM)

---
## Factors that influence r (and most other test statistics)

1. Restriction of range (GRE scores and success)

2. Very skewed distributions (smoking and health)

3. Non-linear associations

4. Measurement overlap (modality and content)

5. Reliability

---
## Reliability

- All measurement includes error

- Score = true score + measurement error (CTT version)

- Reliability assesses the consistency of measurement

--
  Which would you rather have?

  - 1-item final exam versus 30-item?

  - assessment via trained clinician vs tarot cards?

  - fMRI during minor earthquake vs no earthquake?

---
## Reliability

- Cannot correlate error (randomness) with something

- Because we do not measure our variables perfectly we get lower correlations compared to true correlations

- If we want to have a valid measure it better be a reliable measure

---
## Reliability

- think of reliability as a correlation with a measure and itself in a different world, at a different time, or a different but equal version

$$\large r_{XX}$$

---
## Reliability

- true score variance divided by observed variance
- how do you assess theoretical variance i.e., true score variance?

$$\large r_{XY} = r_{X_{T} Y_{T}} {\sqrt{r_{XX}r_{YY}}}$$

$$\large r_{XY} = .6 {\sqrt {(.70) (.70)}}$$

---
## Reliability

$$\large r_{X_{T} Y_{T}} =  = {\frac {r_{XY}} {\sqrt{r_{XX}r_{YY}}}}$$


$$\large r_{X_{T} Y_{T}} =  = {\frac {.30} {\sqrt{(.70)(.70)}}} = .42$$

---
## Most common ways to assess

- cronbachs alpha
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library (psych)
alpha(measure)
## Gives average split half correlation
## Can tell you if you are assessing a single construct
```
- test - retest reliability
- Kappa or ICC

---
## Reliability

- if you are going to measure something do it well

- applies to ALL IVs and DVs, and all designs

- remember this when interpretting other's research

---
## Types of correlations

- Many ways to get at relationship between two variables

- Statistically the different types are almost exactly the same

- Exist for historical reasons

---

## Types of correlations
1. Point Biserial
    +  continuous and dichtomous
2. Phi coefficient
    + both dichotomous
3. Spearman rank order
    + ranked data (nonparametric)
4. Biserial (assumes dichotomous is continous)
5. Tetrachoric (assumes dichotomous is continous)
    + both dichotomous
6. Polychoric (assumes continous)
    + ordinal
