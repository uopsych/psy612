course website:
* include in required materials: LaTex
* Add link to this: https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/raos_tips.pdf

labs overall
* show only broom and kable for creating table summaries throughout
* in lab 9, show them papaja in depth (add links to other options, like stargazer, apaTables, and sjPlot to just create tables in Word)
* incorporate in-text R code to summarize results throughout 

final-project.html
  * More specific guidelines. suggestions commented out in file. 

1-correlation.html

1-lab.html

  * maybe add missingness (but included in class already) -- minihack?
  
3-regression.html

  * add the squares
  * move regression to the mean here

  * add this! https://joshualoftus.com/post/2020-11-23-least-squares-as-springs/least-squares-as-springs/ 
  
3-lab.html

  * it was particularly helpful to draw out the matrices on the board during the matrix algebra section (i.e. draw the Y vector and the X matrix with column of 1’s) and to keep track of matrix dimensions, etc. while explaining the B vector.
  
7-partial.html
  * when to use each: only care about X and Y and controlling for variable; comparions between diff x's and incremental validity; network analysis
  
9-m_regression.html

  * better clarification for adding multiple predictors
  * add slides to walk through predicting Y from dummy codes
  * how was wisdom measured in the psych science article?
  * if time, show how factor variable is doing the same as dummy codes (how?)
  
10-m_regression.html

  * demonstrate that degrees of freedom are the same (ANOVA table and F-test of omnibus)
  * Make F-distribution plot number-free (don't give numbers that don't correspond to example)
  * reiterate example before diving back into R code
  * remind students to do reading?
  
11-diagnostics.html
* add something about weighted least squares (homoscedasticity)

homework-1.html

Question 10.1
* last bullet point should not say "#5 and #6" but should refer to specific models. Suggestions have been made in Markdown files. 

13-dag.html
* add something before about dag models are pre-data collection tools
* add paper by Grosz, Rohrer, & Thoemmes (2020) "The taboo against explicit causal inference in non experimental psychology." As optional reading. Describe during class? 
* include covariates that reduce noise (two different things that should be included in models: confounds and noise)

homework-2.html
* make due last week of class
* weights are 1/predicted values, not predicted values!!!

lab-8.html
* change eemmeans() to lsmeans()
* use pairs() instead of contrast()
* need to specify contrasts before running the model `options(contrasts = c("contr.sum", "contr.poly"))` in order for the apaTables apa.aov.table() function to be correct
* download papaja before lab 9 (this often has errors!!!! do this soon so we can skip troubleshooting in lab 9)
* laTex may need admin privleges 

17-interactions.html
* don't mention regression sums of squares
* remove "most common" sums of squares in slides
* add SPSS and SAS defaults are type III
* add to FA and Regression comparison slide: compare output
* take out sjPlot main effects

lab-9.html
* we will NOT troubleshoot installing papaja at the beginning of this lab
